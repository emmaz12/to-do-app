# MERN Introduction
## Motivation
My goal with this repository is to create a beginner-friendly introduction to the MERN stack. Oftentimes, tutorials are too abstract or too involved. I'd like to find a happy medium where you feel well-equipped but not overwhelemd. I aim to provide a solid foundation from which you can build. Hopefully this foundation will grant them you the confidence to tackle more complex tasks in projects in the future. In the spirit of an introduciton, this guide is far from comprehensive; I've omitted elements I've deemed unnecessary and streamlined certain approaches in the interest of clairty. I encourage anyone who uses this repository to do individual research on elements they feel have been inadequately covered.

## Project
Over the course of this guide, we will be creating a full-stack todo list application. I've chosen a todo list because it is a fairly common first application and provides a good introduction to the various elements of the MERN stack. Here is a [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/uozb4MRUisgH9sEHqFvhUZ/Todo-List) describing the layout and styling of the app. Pardon my rudimentary design skills. The user should be able to create tasks through the input field, mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkmark, and toggle between completed and active tasks. In future updates, we'll be looking into persisting data between browser sessions. As a note, I've also created a reference branch (work in progress) that can be used, as the name sugggests, as a reference. 

With all that out of the way, let's get started with the frontend and React.
